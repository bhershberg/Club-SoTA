# Club SoTA
An open-source SoTA (state-of-the-art) survey tool, with a community generated and maintained dataset. 


# Automate the repetitive stuff
Every IC Designer who publishes their work tends to do three things (1) perform an initial SoTA literature review (2) generate a SoTA comparison table for their paper (3) make a SoTA plot for conference slides. SoTA-tracker takes the repetitive work out of these common tasks, meanwhile enhancing quality and insights.

# Future Roadmap
As a first step, the focus is on creating an ADC survey tool. But the intention is to eventually expand to other circuit categories as well such as DAC, PLL, VCO, ML accelerators, Instrumentation Amplifiers, etc.
